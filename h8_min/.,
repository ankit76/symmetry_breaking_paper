# N<sub>2<\sub> potential energy curve

To get the full curve use

```bash
python pes.py > pes.out
```

The path to the VMC executable needs to be updated in the pes.py script.
Results for d = 1.6 are already in the folder 1.6. It may be necessary to increase the number of stochastic samples to get converged results in some cases.
