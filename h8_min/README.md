# H<sub>8<\sub> potential energy curve

To get the full curve use

```bash
python pes.py > pes.out
```

The path to the VMC executable needs to be updated in the pes.py script.
As an example, results for d = 4.0 are in the folder 4.0. It may be necessary to increase the number of stochastic samples to get converged results in some cases.
