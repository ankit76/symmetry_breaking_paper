# H<sub>50<\sub> potential energy curve

To get the full curve use

```bash
python pes.py > pes.out
```

The path to the VMC executable needs to be updated in the pes.py script.
As an example, results for d = 1.6 are in the folder 1.6. It may be necessary to increase the number of stochastic samples to get converged results in some cases.
